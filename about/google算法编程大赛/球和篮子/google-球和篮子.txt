问题描述
????
You have several identical balls that you wish to place in several baskets. Each basket has the same maximum capacity. You are given an int baskets, the number of baskets you have. You are given an int capacity, the maximum capacity of each basket. Finally you are given an int balls, the number of balls to sort into baskets. Return the number of ways you can divide the balls into baskets. If this cannot be done without exceeding the capacity of the baskets, return 0.
Each basket is distinct, but all balls are identical. Thus, if you have two balls to place into two baskets, you could have (0, 2), (1, 1), or (2, 0), so there would be three ways to do this.
你有几个同样的球，你希望把它放到几个篮子里。每个篮子有相同的容量。给出int 型的baskets,代表篮子的数量。给出int型的 capacity，代表每个篮子的最大容量。给出int型的balls,表示归类到篮子里的球的数量。返回值是把球归类到篮子里的方式的数量。如果不能完全存放到篮子中，无法划分，返回0。
篮子互不同，所有的球相同。因此，如果2个球放到2个篮子里，你可以采用3种方式，即(0, 2), (1, 1), 或 (2, 0)
